This is a procedural map generator, written in Python 3.2 and created by Aaron Kaufman.  It supports natural-looking world
maps of variable size, with or without X and/or Y wrapping.  The main function (with the GUI and so forth) is in tk_view.py.

It requires a nonstandard version of the Python Imaging Library (that being Pillow), which is available here:
